# Decentralized Data Labeling Platform

## Overview
This project is a Web3 and SaaS application designed to facilitate secure and transparent data labeling tasks using blockchain technology. It leverages decentralized solutions to ensure efficient and reliable payments, data management, and user interactions.

## Features
- **Secure Payments**: Automated payment processing using smart contracts on the Solana blockchain.
- **Data Management**: Upload and manage assets securely on AWS S3, with pre-signed URLs for user uploads.
- **User Authentication**: Implemented basic authentication and JWT for secure access.
- **Task Management**: Allows users to create tasks and manage workers efficiently.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Blockchain**: Solana, Web3.js, Solidity
- **Storage**: AWS S3
- **Database**:PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **DevOps**: AWS EC2, CDN for data distribution

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm
- PostgreSQL database
- AWS Account for S3 and EC2 setup
- Solana CLI for blockchain interactions

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/code100x/decentralized-data-labeling-platform.git
   cd decentralized-data-labeling-platform
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your database and AWS S3 bucket. Update configuration files with your credentials.

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
- Create an account and log in to the platform.
- Start creating labeling tasks and manage worker assignments.
- Upload assets and make payments through the integrated payment system.

## Security Considerations
- Implemented measures for securing user-uploaded content.
- Used pre-signed URLs to manage file uploads safely.
- Followed best practices for private key management.
